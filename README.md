# MNIST Digit Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the classic problem of handwritten digit recognition. We use the MNIST dataset, which contains tens of thousands of images of handwritten digits, to train a neural network model to accurately classify these digits. This is a foundational project for anyone interested in computer vision and machine learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/mnist_digit_classification.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd mnist_digit_classification
```

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To start experimenting with the project, open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/mnist_classification.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used in this project, comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale. The dataset is split into training and test sets and can be directly loaded using TensorFlow or from the provided CSV files.

## Model
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit classification. The model architecture is defined in `src/model.py`, and training is performed in the Jupyter notebook.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
