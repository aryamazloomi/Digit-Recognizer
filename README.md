# MNIST Digit Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the classic problem of handwritten digit recognition. We use the MNIST dataset, which contains tens of thousands of images of handwritten digits, to train a neural network model to accurately classify these digits. This is a foundational project for anyone interested in computer vision and machine learning.
